# task 1

- get `./bin` up to speed

some things we need:

- knowledge files -- just `README.md` files in each directory?
- `./bin/check.py`
- underlying `packages/dkdc-sh` library code for running shell commands + nice output
- `./bin/test.py`
- `tests/` for test scripts (do we even really use pytest...?)
- `./bin/task.py` for task management
    - defaults, e.g. monotonically increasing task numbers
- `./bin/version.py` for versioning
- `./bin/commit.py` for committing
- `./bin/up.py` for spinning up the application
