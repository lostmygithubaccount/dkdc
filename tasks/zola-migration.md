# Migrate my old Hugo site to Zola

I have my website scafolded for Zola (including the theme -- no changes needed) in websites/dkdc.io. use websites/dkdc.dev as an example  and scaffold this new webiste -- only about and posts, no dogs/cats. and keep the style more profesional (sentence casing w/ capitalization). the main difference in this site is the theme. the tone will also be more profesional. bootstrap the site so it's looking good -- I'll have it previewed on the side you so you evaluate the build website code as you go.
