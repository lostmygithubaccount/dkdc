title = "The Ghost of Greyfriars"
+++

Every city has its share of ghost stories, and London is no exception. One of the more chilling tales comes from Greyfriars Churchyard, where it is said that the spirit of a monk haunts the grounds. The legend tells of a monk who, centuries ago, broke his vows and was cast out from the order. Unable to find peace in life, his spirit is now doomed to wander the graveyard at night, searching for redemption.

I have not yet seen the specter myself, though many claim to have glimpsed himâ€”a shadowy figure, cloaked and hooded, moving silently among the tombstones. Whether it is truth or mere fancy, I cannot say. But there is something about Greyfriars that feels different after dark, as if the past clings to it, refusing to let go.
