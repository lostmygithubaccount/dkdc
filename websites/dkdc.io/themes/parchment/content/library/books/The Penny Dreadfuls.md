title = "The Penny Dreadfuls"
+++

These cheap, sensational stories have captured the imaginations of the working class, offering thrills and chills for just a penny. While some dismiss them as tawdry and unrefined, I believe there is value in these tales. They provide an escape from the harsh realities of life, and perhaps, in their own way, they speak to deeper truths. Varney the Vampire and Sweeney Todd are but two examples of how the macabre can fascinate and reflect society's darker corners.
