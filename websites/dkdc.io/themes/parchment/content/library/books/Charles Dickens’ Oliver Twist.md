title = "Charles Dickens’ Oliver Twist"
+++


A tale that is all too familiar to those of us who walk the streets of London. Dickens captures the plight of the orphaned and impoverished in a city that often seems indifferent to their suffering. His portrayal of the criminal underworld—of thieves, pickpockets, and rogues—feels uncomfortably close to reality. It is a story of survival, of hope amidst despair, and it speaks to the heart of London itself.
