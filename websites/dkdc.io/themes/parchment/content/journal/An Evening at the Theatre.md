Last night, I attended a performance at the Drury Lane Theatre. The play was Shakespeare’s Hamlet, a favorite of mine. The actor playing the lead delivered a stirring performance, capturing the tragedy and depth of the character. Yet, as I glanced around the audience, I noticed how different we are in the flickering candlelight—some enthralled, others distracted. The theatre, much like the city itself, reflects the many faces of London.
