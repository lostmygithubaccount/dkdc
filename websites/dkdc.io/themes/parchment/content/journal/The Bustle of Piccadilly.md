There are few places in London as lively as Piccadilly. From dawn until dusk, the streets are crowded with carriages, horses, and pedestrians hurrying about their business. I stood by for some time today, watching the ebb and flow of the crowd. The energy is infectious, and one cannot help but feel caught up in the rush of the city. London never sleeps, nor does it wait.
