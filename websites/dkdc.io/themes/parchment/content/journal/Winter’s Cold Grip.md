The chill in the air has been unrelenting this winter. Snow dusts the rooftops, and fireplaces crackle in nearly every home. Yet for the poor, warmth is a scarce commodity. I passed by a workhouse today and saw the weary faces of those less fortunate, huddled together for warmth. This is a season of joy for some, but for many in this city, it is a battle for survival.
