I recently ventured into the heart of Spitalfields, where the weaving factories hum with the sound of labor. The workers, men and women alike, toil for long hours in conditions that would shock the more fortunate of society. It is a stark reminder of the price some must pay for the comforts others enjoy. And yet, amidst the hardship, there is resilienceâ€”a determination to endure.
