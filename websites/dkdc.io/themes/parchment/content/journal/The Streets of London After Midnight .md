As the year draws to a close, I found myself wandering the streets after midnight. The city is eerily quiet, the only sounds coming from the distant clatter of a carriage or the soft murmur of the Thames. London, at this hour, feels like a different placeâ€”one of shadows and secrets. It is a city both asleep and alive, waiting for the dawn of a new year, and with it, new stories to tell.
