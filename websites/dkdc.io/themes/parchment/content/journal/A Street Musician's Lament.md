Walking through the streets of Soho, I came upon a violinist playing a sorrowful tune. His clothes were worn, his eyes sunken with fatigue, but the music he produced spoke of a time before hardship. It struck me then, how many such souls walk unnoticed through this city, their stories untold. London is as much a city of dreams as it is of despair.
