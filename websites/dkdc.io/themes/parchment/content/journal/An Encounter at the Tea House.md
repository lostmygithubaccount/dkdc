This afternoon I found myself at a small tea house, tucked away in a forgotten alley of Covent Garden. As I sipped my tea, I overheard a fascinating conversation between two gentlemen discussing the merits of the newly installed railway system. Their excitement was palpable, yet there was a hint of fear. What shall come of this age of steam and iron? Are we witnessing the birth of a new era or the destruction of the old ways?
