context: I was messing around with `codex` and in my website's repo ran it in `--full-auto` mode then said:

> me: write a random funny shitpost

> codex: (it printed one out)

> me: write it as a post in my blog dumbass

It then read through my posts and wrote the post below, otherwise unedited...

i decided to teach my goldfish python at 3 am. goldie blew a bubble of confusion.

after hours of pair programming, fishpy repo looked like:

```bash
git init fishpy
cd fishpy
touch fish.py
```

fishpy readme:

- feature: flops half-heartedly when code runs
- bug: occasionally gulps water instead of executing loops
- todo: implement neural gill networks for ai-driven swimming

meanwhile, my toaster demanded a go tutorial:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("i am toast.")
}
```

now my toaster identifies as bread, schedules therapy sessions, and my dog writes java and fetches null pointers.

midnight coding with pets: 10/10 recommendation.
